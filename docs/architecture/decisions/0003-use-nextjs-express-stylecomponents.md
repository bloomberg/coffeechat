[6. Use tailwind css instead of emotion](0006-use-tailwind-css-instead-of-emotion.md)

## Context

There are foundational pieces required for any full-stack application. For this
project, we are selecting straight-forward and well known libraries to aid in
our development.

- [Express.js](https://expressjs.com) is the most used Node.js web framework.
- [React.js](https://reactjs.org/) is a well-known and widely used JS library
  for building component-based user interfaces.
- [emotion](https://emotion.sh) is a modern CSS-in-JS framework
- [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) is a framework to "outsource" the complexity of
  running a React app.
- [ESLint](https://eslint.org/) is a static analysis tool to find bugs and
  anti-patterns in javascript (and typescript) code.
- [stylelint](https://stylelint.io/) helps you avoid errors and enforce
  conventions in your styles, and works with emotion out of the box.
- [Prettier](https://prettier.io/) is an opinionated code formatter to avoid
  spending valuable development time agreeing on a code style.

## Decision

- We will use Express.js
- We will use React.js
- We will use emotion
- We will use Next.js
- We will use ESLint
- We will use stylelint
- We will use Prettier
